[Francis Ashbury Pratt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_A._Pratt): _Francis Ashbury Pratt (February 15, 1827 â€“ February 10, 1902) was a Connecticut mechanical engineer, inventor, and co-founder of Pratt & Whitney.
Pratt was born in Peru, New York. In the early 1850s, he designed a milling machine for George S. Lincoln & Company of Hartford, Connecticut, which became the Lincoln miller, in some ways perhaps the most important American machine tool of the late 19th century._
